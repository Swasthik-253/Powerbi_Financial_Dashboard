## Overview
This project focuses on building an interactive financial performance dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into sales, profit, discounts, and cost relationships across various dimensions such as country, product, and time. The aim is to empower businesses to make data-driven decisions by visualizing key financial metrics.

## Objective
The primary objective is to:
1. Analyze financial performance metrics such as sales, profit, and cost.
2. Explore the impact of discounts on sales and profit.
3. Visualize trends across countries, products, and time periods.
4. Provide actionable insights to optimize business strategies.

## Features

  - Cleaned and formatted data fields like `Date`, `Sales`, `Profit`, and `Discount`.
  - Created calculated measures using DAX for in-depth analysis.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Bar chart for sales and profit by country.
  - Line graph for sales and profit trends over time.
  - Scatter plot to analyze the relationship between gross sales and discounts.
  - Heat map to explore sales performance across products and discount bands.
- **Interactivity**:
  - Filters for time range, country, segment, and discount band.
  - Dynamic visuals for seamless data exploration.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Power BI**:
  - Data cleaning, transformation, and modeling.

3. **Total Revenue**:
   - Formula: `Total Revenue = SUM(Gross Sales)`.
4. **Cost-to-Sales Ratio**:
   - Formula: `Cost-to-Sales Ratio = SUM(COGS) / SUM(Sales)`.
